# Own_Text_Editor

Here i have made a text editor like notepad using Tkinter library of Python

I have used different modules of Tkinter Library for this like font, filedialog and colorchooser

Two other modules that i have used are 

i)  win32print -: It's a module encapsulating the windows printing API

ii) win32api -: It's a library of Python Extensions for windows that enables you to use the features of Win32 API on Python

We can also change the color of text, background and foreground as well as it supports dark mode also
